views.py and urls.py are the part in the django; mymiaSeg.py is the functional script which is imported to the views.py; models.py is the database tables which I think is not used in this method.

My idea here is that when running mymiaSeg.py, all of the processes (including fetch data from database, save the segmentation results back to the database) will be finished. All of the images in the database will be segmented when clicking “Run”. 

The html file is just a simple template for testing.
